# Language Purpose/Genesis
## Swift
Swift was first introduced in 2014 at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. Developed by Apple, it was intended to serve as the go-to language to develop native applications on all of Apple's platforms: iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Apple wanted to provide a uniform platform across all of their platforms that would allow developers to easily transition from one to another. Since being rolled out, Swift has seen 4 major versions that have brought with them many changes in reaction to developers' critiques. As a result, Swift has remained near the top of "Most Loved Programming Language" surveys, including a 1st place finish in 2015 and a 2nd place finish in 2016 in StackOverflow's annual developer poll.

Swift was introduced as a replacement for Objective-C, which had been the native language for iOS development since the release of the iPhone in 2008. In contrast to Objective-C, Swift syntax is simple and safe, as well as much more readable. When Swift was introduced, the phrase, "Objective-C minus the C," became popularized because of Swift's ability to hide pointers and other unsafe accessors from the developer. Swift was also developed to feel familiar to other popular Object Oriented (OO) programming languages such as Java and C#; Swift uses familiar syntax such as "dot notation" to make method calls and has access modifiers including `public` and `private`.

While similar to other OO languages, Swift includes features that helps address some major problems that typical OO languages and OO development bring along with them. Perhaps the biggest breakthrough solution that Swift provided were optionals. An optional value may or may not be null, and as a result, must be checked for null before it is used. This construct solves the age-old problem in languages like Java where developers often attempt to access properties or methods on a null reference, ending up in a `NullPointerException`. By default in Swift, there should never be an attempt to access a member on a null reference, because an optional variable must be unwrapped (i.e. checked to see if it is null) before any operations can be performed with it. Swift is also a "protocol-oriented" language, meaning that classes should gain functionality by following or implementing a protocol instead of inheriting from a parent class. This solves a common problem in Java, where every time functionality needs to be added, classes are extended, causing unnecessary complexity to be added to the codebase.
