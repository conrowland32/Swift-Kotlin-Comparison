# Procedural Programming

## Swift
Swift *does* allow Procedural Programming. Unlike Java, Swift does not require everything to be in a class. Also, a linear style with looping, similar to C, is achievable in Swift. Instead of relying on OO concepts, it is possible to break up certain pieces of code into different files and classes, essentially serving as a namespace, then access those in a linear manner. This allows developers to write sequential programs.

## Kotlin

Since functions and variables are both first-class members in Kotlin, it is possible to write procedural programs. By creating classes that contain functions treated statically, classes can be used simply as a modular way to seperate function concerns into different namespaces. It is also possible to place both functions and variables at the top level of a file, outside of any classes at all. These features allows programs to be written in a sequential manner.
