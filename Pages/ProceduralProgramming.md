# Procedural Programming
## Swift
Swift *does* allow Procedural Programming. Unlike Java, Swift does not require everything to be in a class. Also, a linear style with looping, similar to C, is achievable in Swift. Instead of relying on OO concepts, it is possible to break up certain pieces of code into different files and classes, essentially serving as a namespace, then access those in a linear manner. This allows developers to write sequential programs.
