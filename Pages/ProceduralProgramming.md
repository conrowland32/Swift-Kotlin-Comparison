# Procedural Programming

## Swift

---

## Kotlin

Since functions and variables are both first-class members in Kotlin, it is possible to write procedural programs. By creating classes that contain functions treated statically, classes can be used simply as a modular way to seperate function concerns into different namespaces. It is also possible to place both functions and variables at the top level of a file, outside of any classes at all. These features allows programs to be written in a sequential manner.
