# Functional Programming

## Swift
Being a multi-paradigm language, Swift *does* support functional programming. Swift is neither strictly OO nor strictly functional. It does lack some capabilities that fully functional languages like Haskell provide, but it is possible to write in a similar style in Swift.

## Kotlin

Since functions and variables are both first-class members in Kotlin, it is possible to write functional programs. From Kotlin's FAQ:

```
"Kotlin has both object-oriented and functional constructs. You can use it in both OO and FP styles, or mix elements of the two. With first-class support for features such as higher-order functions, function types and lambdas, Kotlin is a great choice if youâ€™re doing or exploring functional programming."
```

In Kotlin, functions can be created as their own type, and passed as parameters to other higher-order functions. This allows for a fairly robust functional programming language.
